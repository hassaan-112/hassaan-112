# 👋 Hey, I’m Hassaan

- 👀 I’m into coding, gaming, and turning random ideas into working apps (sometimes intentionally). 
- 🌱 Currently sharpening my **Flutter & Dart** skills — just finished a month-long internship working on **APIs, GetX, MVVM, Firebase**, and more.
- 💼 I’m working on **Intern Valley**—a mobile app to connect interns and employers.  
- 🔧 Past project highlight: A smart **AI-powered dustbin** using Arduino, ESP32-CAM, and Edge Impulse to detect and sort biodegradable waste. (Yes, it actually works — video on LinkedIn.)  
- 📫 How to reach me: Just scream **"Hassaan !"** into the void—if that doesn’t work, try:  
  - **GitHub:**  [hassaan-112](https://github.com/hassaan-112)  
  - **Email:**   muhammadhassaan1915@gmail.com
  - **LinkedIn:** www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-hassaan-a90ba7250
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (or “Bro” if you’re feeling casua).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I survived uninstalling Instagram months ago… now I just scroll GitHub commits instead.  

**Still figuring out life, but at least I’m debugging it one error at a time.**
